This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. I took the idea from
[[https://github.com/mdo/feedback][@mdo]] who also took the idea from [[https://github.com/holman/feedback][@holman's feedback repo]] and seems like a pretty
fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

--------------

*** Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [[https://github.com/joedicastro/feedback/issues/new][creating a new issue]] on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

--------------

*** Read some questions

Check out the [[https://github.com/joedicastro/feedback/issues?sort%3Dcreated&direction%3Ddesc&state%3Dclosed&page%3D1][Closed Issues]] filter on this repository to browse questions I've
answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone
can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

*** Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
